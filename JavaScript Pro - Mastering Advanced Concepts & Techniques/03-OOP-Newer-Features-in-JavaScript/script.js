  // 1. Defining a Getter

  // NOTE: Getters are defined using the "get" keyword inside an object or a class. You can think of a getter as a method thatâ€™s called when you attempt to read a property.

  const person = {
    firstName: 'Mahmud',
    lastName: 'Hasan',

    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    },
  };

  console.log(person.fullName); // Mahmud Hasan

  //? How Getters Work:
  // No Arguments: A getter does not take any arguments. Its job is simply to return a value based on other properties of the object.

  // Called Automatically: The getter method is automatically called when you access the property. In the above example, person.fullName looks like a regular property but is actually a method call that returns a string.

  // Cannot Set: A getter can only read the value. If you try to assign a value to a getter property, it will not work unless you define a corresponding setter.

  // 2. Using Getters in Classes

  // NOTE: You can also use getters inside classes. Here's an example where we define a Rectangle class with a getter for the area:

  class Rectangle {
    constructor(width, height) {
      this.width = width;
      this.height = height;
    }

    // Getter for calculating the area
    get area() {
      return this.width * this.height;
    }
  }

  const rect = new Rectangle(5, 10);
  console.log(rect.area); // 50

  // 3. Combining Getters with Setters

  // NOTE: Getters are often paired with setters, which allow you to define how properties should be set. While getters are used to access properties, setters are used to modify them.

  const user = {
    firstName: 'Mahmud',
    lastName: 'Hasan',

    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    },

    set fullName(name) {
      const [first, last] = name.split(' ');
      this.firstName = first;
      this.lastName = last;
    },
  };

  console.log(user.fullName); // Mahmud Hasan

  user.fullName = 'Ahmed Khan';
  console.log(user.fullName); // Ahmed Khan
}
